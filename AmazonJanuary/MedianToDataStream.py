# Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. 
# If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. 
# So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
# For example,
# [2,3,4], the median is 3

# [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

# Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

# void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
# double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
